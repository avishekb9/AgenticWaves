## ðŸ“‹ WHAT USERS WILL BE ABLE TO DO

Once deployed, users can:

### Installation
```r
# Install from GitHub
devtools::install_github("avishekb9/AgenticWaves")

# Or clone and install locally
git clone https://github.com/avishekb9/AgenticWaves.git
cd AgenticWaves
source("install.R")
```

### Quick Start
```r
library(AgenticWaves)

# Interactive menu
launch_agentic_waves()

# Shiny dashboard  
run_agentic_waves_app()

# Quick analysis
data <- get_sample_data("global_markets")
agent <- create_autonomous_agent("explorer")
results <- agent$analyze_autonomously(data)
```

### Advanced Usage
```r
# Full workflow
agents <- create_enhanced_agent_population(500)
sim_results <- simulate_enhanced_market_dynamics(agents, data, n_periods = 1000)
spillover_results <- calculate_dynamic_spillover_networks(sim_results)
plots <- generate_publication_dashboard(sim_results, spillover_results)
```
